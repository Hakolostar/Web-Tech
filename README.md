"In my assignment, I utilized HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing web page. HTML5 provided structure and semantics, CSS3 allowed for stylish designs and layouts, and Bootstrap ensured responsiveness. This assignment enhanced my skills in front-end web development, enabling me to create Responsive and user-friendly websites."
